# Physical Layer 
Three Arduino are connected to three different phases of tactical network. Provided arduino code converts analoge voltage and current to digitized signals 
using fixed sampling frequency. Then this digitized signal is transmitted to raspberry pi using serial communication. Signal conditioning blocks used in this 
layer is shown in the Figure below:
